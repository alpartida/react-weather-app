# React Weather App - SheCodes

This is going to be my final project for my SheCodes Workshop which is my 3 and last workshop. I had to create another Weather App :cloud:. In this workshop the requirements were to use React and have live data with a search engine. The project will end up being deployed to Netlify. 

## Current Stage

Below is what it looks like.
